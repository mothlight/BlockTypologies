\section{Summary}
% 150 words
% Motivation
Cities are a stage of human interactions, the foundation of society, a large source of pollution, and the habitat of the majority of the world's population. Although each field investigates cities from its own vantage point, we lack an objective method to compare cities around the world and therefore believe that each city is unique. This has led to repeated reinvention of solutions for problems that occur globally. Additionally, the lack of comparable measurement methods between and within cities starves us of the possibility to learn from previous examples.

% Solution
We present a methodology that can reliably compare not only cities but individual neighbourhoods in a robust manner using an unsupervised learning algorithms, a Self Organising Map (SOM), and map imagery created using a global dataset. The SOM projects n-dimensional spaces onto a 2-dimensional plane and can absorb additional data points and alternative data sets.
% Results
This allows us to compare cities as well as individual neighbourhoods of cities with each other, identify similarities of precincts from different cities and similar patterns of urban structures across the globe. We find that city centres and suburban structures are objectively similar across the globe.
% Future
This method can now be deployed to find correlations with other indicators, to help planners and designers create a path to a desirable future and help manage and govern large urban entities by avoiding past pitfalls.

% City's 'uniqueness' 
As cities grow and evolve, analysis of the basic structural elements of road networks and urban blocks can provide clues as to the processes and governance under which the development occurred. The built environment has been shown to influence a wide range of outcomes, including health, transport, and economic opportunity. Methods to study cities through these basic structural elements are essential to many disciplines conducting urban research and provide a foundation on which they can conducting their research.
% Implication of city structure and form
 % and in particular / especially the road network and block typology,%


% our solution
We propose a novel, quantitative, and objective method to discover city typologies on a neighbourhood scale of street patterns by evaluating city block size and regularity. This follows Louf \& Barthelemy's finding\cite{Louf2014a} that a systematic quantitative method to identify different neighbourhoods is currently lacking. 
%% solution is globally applicabl | updates easily |  Robust | new city characteristics | can accomodate additonal data |
Our method uses 800x800m imagery from Google Maps of custom, abstract, and stylized maps of the world's largest 1692 cities. Using a  computer vision floodfill technique, the size and regularity of city blocks in imagery samples are calculated and histograms constructed for each. A self organising map (SOM), that deploys an unsupervised learning algorithm, sorts these maps into distinct city block typologies. 

% Results
%% Method is robust visible by global results
%% intra inter city similarities
%% Examples from Melbourne (and other cities)
The proposed methodology has evaluated 1.7 million maps from 1692 cities, showing the robustness of the methodology. The resulting SOM, projecting the high dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional plane, is then used to colour code and highlight the map samples according to their SOM x,y coordinates. This highlights similarity between places and has shown to be able to detect city archetypes such as city centres, suburban areas, and even more ephemeral entities such as the city edges (see figure x [Melbourne\_5.png]).
 
This method is not limited to detecting differences within a city, but is able to use a neighbourhood sample in one city and identify similar locations in all other cities. The global and heterogenous collection of 1692 cities indicates the robustness of the methodology in classifying and identifying typologies in the respective map samples through the SOM.

% Maybe we should add a map segment of melbourne CBD and which other areas in the world are similar.


% Future Work
%% Find correlations with other indicators
Since this methodology promises to be applicable across many fields, the aim of future investigation(s) is to find correlations between urban typologies and other indicators. The potential candidates for such investigations are energy intensity, particular matter, and GDP since they are indicators that are globally available. The logical consequence is to test the methodology towards its predictive power and application in design, planning, and management of urban systems.


%For Nature, the abstract is really an introductory paragraph set
%in bold type.  This paragraph must be ``fully referenced'' and
%less than 180 words for Letters.  This is the thing that is
%supposed to be aimed at people from other disciplines and is
%arguably the most important part to getting your paper past the
%editors.  End this paragraph with a sentence like ``Here we
%show...'' or something similar.
\end{abstract}

Then the body of the main text appears after the intro paragraph.
Figure environments can be left in place in the document.
\verb|\includegraphics| commands are ignored since Nature wants
the figures sent as separate files and the captions are
automatically moved to the end of the document (they are printed
out with the \verb|\end{document}| command. However, tables must
be manually moved to the end of the document, after the addendum.

Citation of Einstein's paper \cite{Nice2016}.

%%%\includegraphics{something} % this command will be ignored
\caption{Each figure legend should begin with a brief title for
the whole figure and continue with a short description of each
panel and the symbols used. For contributions with methods
sections, legends should not contain any details of methods, or
exceed 100 words (fewer than 500 words in total for the whole
paper). In contributions without methods sections, legends should
be fewer than 300 words (800 words or fewer in total for the whole
paper).}
\end{figure}

\section*{Another Section}

Sections can only be used in Articles.  Contributions should be
organized in the sequence: title, text, methods, references,
Supplementary Information line (if any), acknowledgements,
interest declaration, corresponding author line, tables, figure
legends.

Spelling must be British English (Oxford English Dictionary)

In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
\textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
 \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
\textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
 \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
format).
 \item The cover letter should also state the number of
words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
\end{enumerate}

See \textsl{Nature}'s website
(\texttt{http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/gta/index.html}) for
complete submission guidelines.

\begin{methods}
Put methods in here.  If you are going to subsection it, use
\verb|\subsection| commands.  Methods section should be less than
800 words and if it is less than 200 words, it can be incorporated
into the main text.

\subsection{Method subsection.}

Here is a description of a specific method used.  Note that the
subsection heading ends with a full stop (period) and that the
command is \verb|\subsection{}| not \verb|\subsection*{}|.
